# DoubleTake

DoubleTake is a [bundler plugin](https://bundler.io/v2.0/guides/bundler_plugins.html) that doubly bundles gems from multiple lockfiles for projects that are using a [dual boot strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-2Xy3RS1ns&t=368s).

The motivation for this tool was for instances where both sets of gems are needed and the gems are decided at boot time. For example: docker images that are built with the gem bundle in a pipeline and can't determine which gem set to use until the docker image is run. A single docker image is useful for debugging as you don't have to guess which image had which gem set.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
plugin "double_take"
```

_NOTE_: We use the `plugin` method, not `gem`.

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

The plugin is installed with an initial `bundle`. Then, every subsequent `bundle` will install all gems from both `Gemfile.lock` and `Gemfile_next.lock`.

_NOTE_: This plugin does not generate a `Gemfile_next.lock`, keep both lockfiles in sync over gem bumps, nor does it implement any strategy for bifurcating the `Gemfile` to load different gems. For those reasons, this plugin pairs really well with [`bootboot`](https://github.com/Shopify/bootboot). For more info on dual booting I recommend reading its `README`.

As mentioned in the `bootboot` plugin the `Gemfile` needs to be bifurcated with the environment variable `DEPENDENCIES_NEXT`.


### Clean
The `bundle clean` command is useful for removing unused gems on your system. The problem is that the default `bundle clean` only respects the gem set in `Gemfile.lock` which will remove any differing gems in `Gemfile_next.lock`. To avoid this, you can use the command:

    $ bundle double_take clean

It accepts all options that bundler's clean command does:

    $ bundle double_take clean --help
    $ bundle double_take clean --dry-run
    $ bundle double_take clean --force


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
